# Marathon Landing Page

## Description
This landing page is designed to promote and sell tickets for a 10 km race in Chisinau. I was inspired by websites that sell tickets for running events. The page provides essential details about the race, including the eventâ€™s purpose, testimonials from past participants (my friends btwðŸ™ƒ), pricing, and frequently asked questions. 

The goal of this page is to attract runners of all levels by offering a clear and engaging experience while making the registration process simple.
